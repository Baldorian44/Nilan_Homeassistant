# Make your Nilan Air ventilating system way more cool ;)

This little cool project lets you use you Home Assistant to control and read values from your Nilan air vent system.

The code for the project is not developed by me, but I made some adjustmenst to it, so it would integrate better with Home Assistant. The project is originally made for use with OpenHab.
